Star Wars API Zendcon Module
----------------------------

This repo is the code that was developed in the Apigility tutorial 
at Zendcon 2016. It is intended to be placed in the Apigility 
Skeleton project. On its own, it will do nothing, but combined with
Apigility, for great justice, it will provide a RESTFUL API that
will allow you to look at films and people that were are associated
to Star Wars.
